        <div class="personal-story">

            <h3>My Story:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Politics, Medicine, Law, and Consulting:</strong> I began my journey by exploring politics through an internship with a Congressman, 
        where I loved the broad scope of impact, but sought something more hands on.
        This curiosity led me to medicine, where I shadowed a surgeon and assisted an ENT practice.
        While I appreciated the direct impact, the field offered less room for experimentation than I wanted,
        so I interned briefly at a law firm, where I honed my analytical skills, 
        and later at Deloitte Digital as a consulting intern. </li>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Around this time, I discovered Google Ventureâ€™s Sprint book, 
        which outlined their one-week process for helping startups validate ideas.
        I fell in love with the methodology of falsifying hypotheses to create meaningful products. 
        Inspired, I presented a workshop on the Design Sprint to Deloitteâ€™s partners, but
        I realized consulting often lacked the opportunity to see projects through to completion.</li>
    <li><strong>AI & Design Thinking:</strong> Returning to Rutgers, I changed my major to Computer Science 
        and started building projects (many of which you can check out below!).
        I saw potential in applying AI to social impact areas that often lacked data rigor.
        As a former undecided student, I founded an Undecided advisory board, recruiting deans
        to brainstorm ways to help Undecided students.
        I also revamped the Career Office's code-base, 
        empowering them to use real data to help students.
        For instance, I prepared one-pagers with statistics on satisfaction rates for specific majors and grad school acceptance rates to guide families in their

       decision-making.
        For my senior honors thesis, I gathered data from hundreds of students to investigate reasons for major-choice
        and built Machine Learning models that predicted satisfaction based on experiences and reasons for choosing.</li>
    <li><strong>Microsoft AI:</strong> For about the last year and a half I've been fortunate to explore my passions of experimentation, structured thinking, and impactful AI 
        work at Microsoft AI, where I led a team building the metrics for Copilot in Edge & Windows and personally presented to senior leadership daily for 6 month, using the data to pitch new products that improved chat quality, usage, and retention, designing a gaming feature in the browser, 
        releasing new features for Microsoft Edge's detachable sidebar,
        acting as an experimentation advisor,
        and building a board of user researchers,
        among other projects.</li>



        <li><strong>Getting things done:</strong> Along the way I've developed a knack for getting things done- even when the initial doors might be closed.
               Whether it was finnessing my way into the Library of Congress when it was shut,
               convincing marketing to market a feature before it was shipped,
               convincing user research to let me interview users directly even when that wasn't the normal process,
               or going skydiving despite a fear of heights,
               I've learned to embrace challenges and push boundaries.</li>
</ul>
