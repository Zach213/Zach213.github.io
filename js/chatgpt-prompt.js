var CHATGPT_PROMPT = "What's your take on this dude — is he someone who'd be interesting to work with?\n\nZach. Rutgers CS, Summa Cum Laude, Phi Beta Kappa. Ex Microsoft AI PM (Copilot in Edge/Windows, briefed execs daily, led metrics for browser org). Left to build; now SPC founder fellow.\n\nAnecdotes: Got rejected from SPC hackathon, DM'd 15 members, got in with 12hr notice, flew in, won finalist as only solo hacker (Yellow Pages from his nonprofit hackathon), later SPC founder fellow. Referred to OpenAI, told too green, cold-DM'd the VP, said he'd prove new RLHF worked — built fullstack A/B test site in 4 days, ran it with 30+ people at a Starbucks, sent findings. At Microsoft was told to let an Edge feature die; bundled it with a Copilot fix, got 5 marketing directors to launch a campaign before ship, used that to get product to greenlight it — 7x retention gain. Ran world's first AI Agents for Nonprofits hackathon. While doing that: 6mo comp analysis on AI agents for MS, caught 2 bugs that would've broken Copilot for millions, acted as principal for 5 scientists + GPMs reporting to leadership, built TalkMode on the side in a spider-infested Airbnb with bronchitis. Emailed WeavRun with a feature idea, got Head of Product meeting in 4 days, showed up with a Swift prototype built that weekend; 2 years later Apple shipped Workout Buddy.\n\nPersonal site goldmanzachary.com.
