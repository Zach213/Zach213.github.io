                    Extended (Tryextended.com) is a browser overlay that lets you talk to any website and have it change. Think Minecraft creative mode, for the internet.
                    <br><br>
                    Agentic browsers are just rebranded Chrome extensions that someone else built for specific sites that tend to be slow, inaccurate, and non-editable. Until now, it's been hard to make them yourself: don't wait for Perplexity & OpenAI to guess what use cases you care about - build it yourself, in minutes.
                    <br><br>
                    Extended works by building a real Chrome extension through natural language to accomplish what you want and reloading the page with the new functionality automatically.

                    <h4>Market Gap</h4>
                    <p>Google is neglecting extensions and not making the connection between agents & extensions. Companies offering agentic browsers are cherrypicking use cases that would be better solved by one-off chrome extensions.</p>

                    <p>Icons aren't generated automatically since extension documentation wasn't reflected well in LLM training data. Built solution with accessibility permissions and boilerplate removal.</p>

                    <p>Even developers preferred the in-browser IDE version, with one saying they'd ditch Claude Code if this worked. However, most "workflow builders" are solutions in search of problems.</p>
