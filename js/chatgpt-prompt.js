Each one opened a different Portal:\n– a pre-signed-in demo account\n– a Chrome extension running on your phone (no install)\n– local files zipped and shared live\n– an AI Agent giving a demo\n\nNo accounts.\nNo downloads.\nNo sales calls.\n\nAt the end of the night, instead of paying for Kahoot, I built a React quiz on localhost:3000, zipped it, uploaded it to Portal, and handed the link to the room.\nEveryone got their own isolated browser session.\n\nWhen they closed it, it reset.\nWhat still feels magical isn't the quiz.\n\nIt's that a link can now boot a live, isolated runtime - even for something running locally - and safely hand it to 20 people at once.\n\nWe also just published our docs & are hiring.\n\nIf you have a product that has friction to try at certain moments (be it a new feature test, user research, or for pre-sales):\nDon't send a video.\nSend a Portal.\n\nPOST 2 (1w ago):\nWe just let over 100 people try our product without signing up.\nHere's what happened.\n\nDuring our Product Hunt launch for Portal (SPC F25), we let people open a Portal into their own isolated temporary browser session in under 2 seconds - logged into a real analytics product or the actual Portal builder.\n\nOn average, they spent ~3 minutes exploring. About a third tried both.\nBut the stats weren't the interesting part.\n\nThe behavior was.\n\nWhen people are told they can't break anything, they get curious.\n\nThey click everything. Wander off the happy path. Try to close the page. Ask the AI what else they can do.\n\nThat surfaced UX and session edge cases we never would've found internally - and teams reached out to use this for their own high friction moments.\n\nWe're already seeing creative uses:\n- replacing first demo calls\n- teaching creators how a product works\n- sharing Chrome extensions without installs\n- deploying local files for 10 minutes with analytics\n\nPOST 3 (1w ago):\nPortal just launched Product Hunt today & my laptop is barely making it, as I woke up to #10 of the day and moving fast.\n\nPortal lets you send a link to a real product experience - a live browser session opened at a specific state - so people can actually try software instead of watching a video or hopping on a call.\n\nThis launch comes right after the South Park Commons Demo Faire, lots of late nights, and a quick filmed video.\n\nIf you're curious about getting a link you can send for:\n- onboarding\n- user research\n- sharing localhost / extensions\n- product demos\n- ephemeral agentic sandboxes\n- future co-browsing sessions to never screen share again\n\nPOST 4 (2w ago):\nThe past few weeks before demo faire at South Park Commons have been a lot of fun, working with folks to build Portals - which is the fastest way to let people try your product.\n\nFolks have been setting up Portals to send instead of a first sales call, lead gen, as an artifact for user research or to guide onboarding with zero effort to try.\n\nSome folks thought it'd take weeks or require lots of coding to set up a cloud browser at their product's magic moment with an AI & were surprised when we'd build one in minutes.\n\nPOST 5 (4w ago):\nThe future of AI interfaces to try products for the vast majority of people is not going to be MCP & it's not going to require you to code at all.\n\nThat's the bet we're making at Portal.\n\nInstead, Portal lets you bring your product as is with the interface you've built, choose the exact state you want folks to be dropped into, and let people try it in a secure sandbox.\n\nThat could be in a demo account, with local files, or with integrations that users might not trust implementing before they've even decided to buy.\n\nWith a Figma-like editor, Portal lets you drag & drop what's off limits, and even add an AI trained on your documentation to answer any questions or give a product demo.\n\nYou get a link you can send to let anyone try your product at that safe state with an AI guide, getting analytics on how they use it, lowering the barrier to try it down to nothing.\n\nThis can help replace first demo calls entirely without scheduling, setup, onboarding, or help with user research.\n\nPOST 6 (1mo ago):\nLast year on Twitter, a billionaire said he was hiring hardcore engineers and asked people to drop a project they'd built.\n\nThe top reply?\n\"I'll let my work speak for itself: localhost:8000/index.html\"\n\nYou can't actually send localhost, it only exists on your computer.\n\nBut we kept asking: what if you could?\nWhat if sending localhost was as easy as sharing a Google Doc link?\n\nA few weeks back, 25 founders scanned a QR code and instantly opened ephemeral isolated Portals to my localhost project, on their phones, at the same time.\n\nInstead of seeing a screen shared demo, they could actually click around in Play Mode.\nThey asked questions to an AI I'd given documentation to.\nThey experienced the product.\n\nBuilding software is easier than ever.\nSharing it is still stuck decades back.\nPortal is working to fix that.\n\nWe let you capture & share any product state with temporary access, guardrails, and an AI that answers questions 24/7. Zero code.\n\nFounders & sales teams are already replacing videos/slides/demo calls with Portals for self-serve qualification, onboarding, and user research.\n\nPOST 7 (2mo ago):\nToday I'm sharing something I've never seen posted on LinkedIn before: a full AI-led demo built with zero code.\n\nThis lets them drop prospects into the exact product state they want - already logged in, configured, and loaded with data - and have AI run a demo.\n\nAn AI that can:\n- walk prospects through a real product\n- answer questions\n- click, scroll, navigate\n- guide objections / follow scripts\n- personalize the journey\n- and drive to a CTA\n...all in a sandboxed environment of your actual product.\n\nPortal is the fastest way to build an AI-led or new User-led demo; this AI-led demo took just minutes to build.\n\nZero code.\n\nYou shouldn't need to re-build your product to be agentic.\nBring your website & just make a Portal.\n\nPOST 8 (2mo ago):\nPortal (SPC F25) just made history.\n\n2 days after Portal's launch, at a private SPC pre-demo day event for VC partners & founder fellows, I tried something I'd never seen anyone do before.\n\nInstead of ending our presentation with a website link or video...\n...I ended with a QR code to a live Portal.\n\n\"Scan this and try a Chrome extension on your phone - instantly.\"\nNo installs. No setup. No app switching.\n\nWhen 20+ founders scanned it, they instantly opened a real Chrome extension on their phones - no install, no friction.\n\nFounder Fellows asked if they could use Portals for their own demo day.\nAnother founder tried refreshing ~40 times to beat the view limit.\nOthers came up after asking how they could integrate Portals into their onboarding.\n\nPeople don't want to watch a demo anymore.\nThey want to experience the product.\n\nPOST 9 (2mo ago):\nWe just raised a committed $1m from South Park Commons to build Portal (SPC F25): a first of its kind user-led AI demo sandbox - that lets prospects try your product instantly, with AI guiding them through the exact story your team wants.\n\nYou can let prospects actually try your product in a safe, stateful sandbox - signed into a dummy account, with PII scrubbed, or with software pre-installed - and ask AI (trained on your docs) how to do anything as they open to your magic moment.\n\nPortal also supports AI-led demos, where the AI dynamically runs through pre-set paths based on what users ask, answering questions & asking discovery questions back.\n\nBuilt for sales teams, with features you can't find elsewhere:\n- Phone-a-Friend: the AI can call a rep directly into the demo\n- Auto-updating demos (no more SE rebuilds)\n- No-code demo builder for web, local files, or apps\n- World-class analytics with first-party behavioral insights\n\nHey, I'm Zach - I left Microsoft AI's Copilot Analytics team 6 months ago & built Portal - sandbox links that let anyone experience a product instantly, with an AI that can guide or demo it.\n\nPortal's mission is to make links for every product state on earth, making them reachable, and explainable. We think every product is incomplete unless it can explain how it works, by itself, to someone new, and South Park Commons agreed, committing $1m behind it in the founder fellowship.\n\nLast September, I was in a disability lab in Seattle, working on an extension I'd built to use voice to control computers, but installing the Chrome extension on the machines kept getting in the way of feedback, and it made me realize something simple:\n\nTrying software shouldn't require installing it.\n\n=== LINKEDIN EXPERIENCE ===\n\nFounder - Portal (SPC F25)\nAug 2025 - Present · 7 mos\nSan Francisco Bay Area\nBuilding the fastest way for someone to try your product at its magic moment for sales, user research, and onboarding.\n\nFounder Fellow (F25) - South Park Commons\nOct 2025 · 1 mo\nFunded as a portfolio company. On a mission to make every product instantly tryable & explainable - by turning statefulness into a shareable artifact.\n\nODF26 Cohort - ODF\nSep 2025 · 1 mo\n\nProduct Manager - Microsoft AI\nAug 2023 - May 2025 · 1 yr 10 mos\nSeattle, Washington\n\nHelped turn Bingchat into Copilot, made it give better answers & load faster, then left to build a startup.\n\nAt Microsoft AI, I:\n- Led Edge/Windows Copilot model metrics for entire browser org: briefed execs daily, made Copilot load faster & give better answers with applied scientists/SWEs, ran Browser AI Agents comp research, gave lectures on system architecture of Copilot to 50+ architects/partner team members.\n- Built roadmap to save & ship Edge Bar's auto-start alongside 7x user retention increasing features with a wonderful team (ML notifications, Microsoft AI-wide A/B testing infrastructure, gaming features, audits).\n- Built interactive marketing landing pages & causal attribution tools for XXXM MAU visit-surfaces with a great PMM/engineering team.\n- Created cross-org v-team to promote user feedback, leading to 40+ user studies & 1st PM in 2 years approved to interview users directly by leadership & user research org.\n- Misc: Experimentation statistics champ: unblocked major Copilot launches & gave causal advice, personally pitched CEO on self-built SOTA computer use agent.\n\nLeft to democratize Computer Use in accessibility/nonprofits then scale a startup.\n\n=== EDUCATION ===\n\nRutgers University-New Brunswick\nBachelor's degree, Computer Science, minor Quantitative Economics\n2019 - 2023\nSumma Cum Laude, Phi Beta Kappa (Junior inductee), Druskin, Scarlet, Excellence Scholarships, CS Faculty Student Project Award & 1st @ IEEE Hackathon 2021, Honors Government, Rutgers Film Productions.\n\n=== PORTAL DOCS (makeportals.com) ===\n\nIntroduction:\nThink of a Portal like a link to a kiosk at a science fair showing off a specific app. Technically, it's a link to a locked-down browser in a cloud computer that's being shown on a page, with a secure runtime choosing what is clickable, and an optional AI.\n\nThat experience can be:\n- Local files: Upload HTML, a React app, or static assets; Portal serves them in an isolated browser.\n- A Chrome extension: Upload a zip; recipients get the extension pre-installed in the session.\n- A particular session state: A saved snapshot (cookies, tabs, scroll) so the session opens already on the right page with the right data.\n- For enterprises: persistent sessions where visitors stay logged in.\n\nPlay Mode:\nThe visitor is in the driver's seat. They get a live browser in the state you chose (e.g. logged into a demo account, on a specific page). They can click around and explore. You set guardrails, allowed URLs, blocked elements, so they stay where you want. Optionally you add an AI in the sidebar to answer questions; the AI doesn't take over. Session is sandboxed and time-limited. You get analytics on what they did.\n\nWatch Mode:\nYou script the steps (what the AI says, where it clicks); the visitor watches and can ask questions. The AI leads; the user doesn't click.\n\nPortal Spec:\nPortal is: a declarative, runnable snapshot of software state, delivered as a link. Think of it alongside OpenAPI, Dockerfile, Terraform, not alongside product tours or demo capture tools.\n\nPortal sits earlier in the funnel: try before you automate, evaluate before you delegate.\n\nPortal invariants:\n- Sessions are always isolated. One person per session; no shared state between visitors.\n- Sessions always reset after they end. When the session ends, the VM is destroyed.\n- No data persists between sessions.\n- Users cannot affect production. The session runs in an isolated cloud environment.\n- Guardrails are enforced continuously.\n\nEnterprise:\n- Persistent auth (OAuth, SSO, 2FA supported)\n- Hydration (declarative setup before prospect sees anything)\n- Reset (declarative teardown when session ends)\n- API blocking (block specific network calls)\n- Multi-demo accounts, multi-tab, multi-region, warm pools (sub-2s session start), concurrency control, session analytics\n- SOC 2 compliance in progress\n\nUse cases:\nDevRel workshops, Chrome extension sharing, founders sharing WIP, sales demos, onboarding, user research, shared Portals instead of FaceTime or screen share on calls.\n\n=== PERSONAL SITE (goldmanzachary.com) ===\n\nHey, I'm Zach\nBuilding Portal (SPC F25). Previously doing a self-directed incubator.\nprojects · writings\n\nSome anecdotes:\n\nCold-messaging my way to SPC founder fellow:\nWas pitching TalkMode to Microsoft/OpenAI & thought getting the CPO of Anthropic to say it was a good idea would help. Saw an SPC hackathon with Anthropic - but got rejected. DM'd 15 SPC members, got in with 12 hours notice, booked a flight immediately. Convinced them to let me be the only solo hacker, won finalist with Yellow Pages from my nonprofit hackathon, got to go to event with CPO of Anthropic - asked him about computer use/accessibility which he said was a great idea - used in pitch later. Months later accepted as SPC member then founder fellow a week in.\n\nReferred to OpenAI & cold dm'ing the VP:\nWas referred to OpenAI then told I was too green by a hiring manager, so cold dmed my way to the VP who I sent a video saying I'd prove a new version of RLHF worked better - in 4 days I built a fullstack site to test it with A/B tests from scratch, sat in starbucks near Seattle University to test it with 30+ Gen Z including grad students and sent them a summary of findings.\n\nMicrosoft AI political maneuvering to save a feature:\nWas told to let an Edge feature die. Instead, bundled the PR with a Copilot fix, convinced 5 marketing directors to launch a campaign for a feature before it even shipped - then used that momentum to force product leadership to greenlight it. Saved the feature and led to a 7x retention gain.\n\nHosting the world's first agents for nonprofits hackathon:\nOrganized the world's first AI Agents for Good Hackathon from scratch.\n\nUrgent care visits, agents, and startups:\nWhile dealing with the political maneuvering:\n- Led competitive analysis on AI Agents for Microsoft for 6 months (built a competitive analysis agent myself).\n- Caught & fixed two separate bugs that would have broken Windows Copilot for millions of users.\n- Acted essentially as principal applied scientist assigning work items (at some points reviewing PRs) to a team of 5 scientists representing the Edge org alongside GPMs from Windows & Bing in reporting & analyzing core Copilot metrics daily directly to leadership.\n- Balanced all of this while building TalkMode, living in a spider-infested Airbnb with bronchitis.\n\nBuilt Apple's Workout Buddy 2 years earlier:\nBack in 2023, my favorite app while learning how to run was WeavRun, an IOS app that changed the pace of the music playing when you sped up. I emailed the company with the feature idea, got a meeting with the Head of Product 4 days later, and came to that meeting with a full working prototype having learned Swift over the weekend. I got design feedback and an offer to be added as a developer to WeavRun so I could use it after they shut it down! 2 years later Apple launched Workout Buddy - validating the pain point.\n\n=== SUBSTACK: Hi to 6 in 3 ===\n\nI quit Microsoft AI over 3 weeks ago to build what I wish existed - and test 6 new ways to democratize AI every two weeks with real users.\n\nWhy I left:\nIn mid-April, I was offered a major project in Microsoft AI. Instead of taking it, I chose to leave Microsoft after nearly 2 years to build full-time.\n\nI'd gone into product after reading The Sprint Book & loving the idea of quickly testing hypotheses. At Microsoft, I built & improved metrics for Copilot in Edge & Windows, saved then released a 7x retention consumer product, and worked across notifications, gaming, experimentation, ML-driven notifications & more, balancing 3+ projects at a given time & starting a cross-org team to encourage more user research, as the first PM in my org to interview users directly in 2 years.\n\nWhat I'll be doing:\nI'll be running six sprints in three months, each one designed to test, fast, if the ideas can deliver real value - in speed, savings, or accuracy - for real users.\n\nI'm not betting on a single feature. I'm betting that velocity compounds.\n\n=== SUBSTACK: Sprint 1 - Yellow Pages ===\n\nTLDR: For my 1st sprint, I helped nonprofits keep their social service directories up to date. I built Yellow Pages, a website to have LLMs monitor and summarize website changes, de-duplicate their existing data, and verify new information via screenshots with a from-scratch built computer-use deep research agent 10x faster and 3x cheaper than OpenAI's since other deep research tools were too slow, unreliable, and expensive for contact details. Since my February Agents for Nonprofits hackathon, 2 nonprofits have been helped with the features and now a 3rd is using the actual site, saving hundreds of hours.\n\nHypotheses:\n- For Deep Research, Screenshots are an under-rated feature that saves time verifying lack of hallucinations. Validated.\n- For Computer Use Agents, website monitoring is a killer use case. Validated.\n- Nonprofits would pay for a dashboard to de-duplicate, monitor changes of websites of social services. Invalidated: Not seen as high value enough to pay with limited resources.\n\nLearnings:\n- Isolating the real minimum value-prop\n- The web is dynamic: determining what information to put into the context window of an LLM, how many calls, and guaranteeing deterministic output\n- UI: How it solves a user's problem > tech matters way more\n- Decision-makers over operators: go to decision makers first.\n\n=== SUBSTACK: Sprint 2 - Tryextended.com ===\n\nLovable for Chrome Extensions. I built a dev tool that helps you build, debug, and share Chrome Extensions instantly because every modern agent is basically a Chrome Extension in disguise.\n\nInsight: Every single web agent nowadays is literally what we would've called a Chrome Extension acting on a webpage two years ago. Companies offering agentic browsers essentially are cherrypicking use cases where a specific workflow is done on a specific website that'd be better off solved by a one-off chrome extension.\n\nLearnings:\n- Most workflow builders aren't tools: they're homework. Users don't know what workflows they want automated.\n- Sprint 3's carried me over into Sprint 6 (where I'm at now), since I got validation after validation for the next rounds of hypotheses.\n\nWhat do you think - is this someone you'd want to work with, invest in, or partner with?";
