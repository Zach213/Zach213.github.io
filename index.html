            <h3> Intro </h3>
            <p>
                My journeyâ€”from politics to product, from a 
                congressional internship to AI innovationâ€”has been 
                about building skills to apply data to social impact.
            </p>
            <h3>My Story:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Exploring the building blocks of impact- from Politics to Product:</strong> I started exploring politics through an internship with a Congressman, 
        where I loved the broad scope of impact, but sought something more hands on.
        This curiosity led me to medicine, where I shadowed a surgeon and assisted an ENT practice.
        While I appreciated the direct impact, the field offered less room for experimentation than I wanted,
        so I interned briefly at a law firm, where I honed my analytical skills, 
        and later at Deloitte Digital as a consulting intern. </li>
    <li><strong>Discovering design sprints and iteration:</strong> Around this time, I discovered Google Ventureâ€™s Sprint book, 
        which outlined their one-week process for helping startups validate ideas.
        I fell in love with the methodology of falsifying hypotheses to create meaningful products. 
        Inspired, I presented a workshop on the Design Sprint to Deloitteâ€™s partners, but
        I realized consulting often lacked the opportunity to see projects through to completion.</li> Returning to Rutgers, I changed my major to Computer Science 
        and started building projects (many of which you can check out below!).
        I saw potential in applying AI to social impact areas that often lacked data rigor, so worked with CARE Somalia to build sites for medical staff to track maternity visits.
        As a former Undecided student, I founded an Undecided advisory board, recruiting deans
        to brainstorm ways to help Undecided students.
        I also revamped the Career Office's code-base, 
        empowering them to use real data to help students with one-pagers on specific majors to guide families' decision making.
        For my senior honors thesis, I gathered data from hundreds of students to investigate reasons for major-choice
        and built Machine Learning models that predicted satisfaction based on experiences and reasons for choosing.</li>
    <li><strong>Driving impact at scale-working at Microsoft AI:</strong> For about the last year and a half I've been fortunate to explore my passions of experimentation, structured thinking, and impactful AI 
        work at Microsoft AI, where I've worked on feature work, metrics, experimentation, and user research (see below). Together, I've been building a skillset of data-informed product decision making.</li>

        <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> Along the way I've developed a knack for getting things done- even when the initial doors might be closed.
               Whether it was finnessing my way into the Library of Congress when it was shut to the public,
               convincing marketing to market a feature before it was shipped,
               convincing user research to let me interview users directly even when that wasn't the normal process,
               or going skydiving despite a fear of heights,
               I've learned to embrace challenges and push boundaries.</li>
</ul>
